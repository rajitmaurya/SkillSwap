## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, most learning platforms are paid and not accessible to everyone.  
Many students and learners are unable to afford expensive courses, even though they are eager to learn new skills.

At the same time, many individuals already possess valuable skills but lack a platform to share and exchange them with others.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The idea behind SkillSwap came from a simple thought:  
**“Why should learning be limited by money when people can learn from each other?”**

During the hackathon, I aimed to build a practical solution to a real-world problem.  
This led to the development of a platform where knowledge can be shared freely and collaboratively.
